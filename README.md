# Under Construction
I am in the process of making some major changes here so I'm temporarily putting this repo into *under construction* status. 

What is coming:
1) An updated, single jupyter notebook to train, test, and then export mask rcnn models to torchscript. 
2) A document listing the steps to install deteectron2 and my software on various platforms (MS Windows 10, MacOS on Intel, MacOS on M1/M2) 
3) A fully standalone software framework
4) A wxpython based UI to train and export models (like the notebook)
5) A wxpython based UI which utilizes those trained models to find animals within video and then save individual AVIs for each animal regardless of the complexity of the background
6) Sample code that shows how you could use my framework in your own project
7) As a bonus, there's a wxpython based UI to playback the animal outlines (contours) without even having the original video (PklPlayer). 

Stay Tuned. I expected to revive this repo within the next week.
